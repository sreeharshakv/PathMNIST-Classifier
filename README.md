# PathMNIST-Classifier

## Objective
This project aims to classify histopathological tissue images into one of nine classes using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. The classification system assists in identifying different types of tissue, which aids medical professionals in diagnostics and research.

## Dataset
The PathMNIST dataset is derived from a study focused on using colorectal cancer histology to forecast patient prognosis. It contains 100,000 unique images of tissue samples stained with specific dyes, split into a training set (90%) and a validation set (10%), with an additional 7,180 images for testing that come from a separate medical facility. This dataset categorizes tissue into nine different types and is available in three image resolutions: 28x28, 64x64, 128x128, and 224x224 pixels.

The dataset is hosted as part of a larger dataset [MedMNIST](https://github.com/MedMNIST/MedMNIST).
